GOAL:

This code: Receive and publish notes from Linux USB users who want to
share their testing results on if USB devices have proper power
management.

Overall: Improve the Linux community's ability to configure USB power
management.

WHAT IT DOES:

This code does the following very simple things:

* Runs a service that accepts notes from users.

* Publishes a tarball of those notes.

HOW IT DOES ABUSE FILTERING:

* It checks for a special string in the submitted input.

PRIVACY IMPLICATIONS:

* FIXME...

SAMPLE SUBMIT SCRIPT:

* Provided as sample_submit.py.

WHAT IT IS NOT FOR:

The plan is that this code (on the web) will only receive, store, and
publish the notes from users.

Any analysis scripts should be run elsewhere. (That way, I don't have
to personally manage deploying them.)

CONTRIBUTING:

https://github.com/paulproteus/receive-and-publish-usb-vampires

I should put more docs here.

RUNNING THE CODE:

virtualenv .
./bin/python setup.py develop
./bin/python vampire_list/__init__.py

Now you have the service listening on localhost:8080.

MONITORING:

Since this provides an active web service, it's helpful to know if the
service is working.

There should be a URL here for where you can check if the service is up.

LICENSING:

CC Zero.
